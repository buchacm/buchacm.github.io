The starting point of my research is an enumeration problem: the enumeration of lattice walks restricted to convex cones. The problem can be approached by considering the associated generating function and solving the functional equation it satisfies. To solve the equation means to decide whether its solution satisfies an algebraic or differential equation and determine such an equation. There are different ways this can be done. My work follows an algebraic approach which considers generating functions not as analytic but formal objects and restricts to methods that rely on elementary power series algebra only.          

These methods give rise to basic algebraic problems that are interesting themselves and arise in other contexts too. Applications are found in parameter identification in ode models, computer vision and design of optical systems, for instance.

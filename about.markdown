I am a mathematician who works on problems which arise in algorithmic enumerative combinatorics. My research interests range from enumerative combinatorics, constructive algebra, effective algebraic geometry and differential algebra to dynamical systems.

On this webpage you can find a research statement, published and not yet published articles, software, slides of selected presentations, information on talks, conferences, research visits, teaching, and a short CV.
